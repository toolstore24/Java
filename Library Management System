Designing and implementing a complete Java Library Management System from scratch here would be beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with a basic outline and code snippets for the core functionalities: adding books, adding members, borrowing books, and returning books.

Please note that this is a simplified version, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to consider various aspects like database integration, user authentication, error handling, and more.

Here's a high-level outline of the classes and functionalities:

Book class: Represents a book with properties like title, author, ISBN, etc.
LibraryMember class: Represents a library member with properties like name, ID, etc.
Library class: Main class to manage books, members, borrowing, and returning books.
Book.java

public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private String isbn;
    private boolean available;

    public Book(String title, String author, String isbn) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.isbn = isbn;
        this.available = true;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    // ...
}

public class LibraryMember {
    private String name;
    private int memberId;

    public LibraryMember(String name, int memberId) {
        this.name = name;
        this.memberId = memberId;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    // ...
}

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class Library {
    private List<Book> books;
    private List<LibraryMember> members;
    private Map<Book, LibraryMember> borrowedBooks;

    public Library() {
        this.books = new ArrayList<>();
        this.members = new ArrayList<>();
        this.borrowedBooks = new HashMap<>();
    }

    // Add a book to the library
    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book);
    }

    // Add a library member
    public void addMember(LibraryMember member) {
        members.add(member);
    }

    // Borrow a book
    public void borrowBook(Book book, LibraryMember member) {
        if (book.isAvailable()) {
            book.setAvailable(false);
            borrowedBooks.put(book, member);
            System.out.println(member.getName() + " borrowed " + book.getTitle());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, the book is not available for borrowing.");
        }
    }

    // Return a book
    public void returnBook(Book book) {
        if (borrowedBooks.containsKey(book)) {
            book.setAvailable(true);
            LibraryMember member = borrowedBooks.get(book);
            borrowedBooks.remove(book);
            System.out.println(member.getName() + " returned " + book.getTitle());
        } else {
            System.out.println("The book was not borrowed from this library.");
        }
    }

    // Getters for books and members
    // ...
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();

        // Add books to the library
        Book book1 = new Book("Java: The Complete Reference", "Herbert Schildt", "978-0071808552");
        Book book2 = new Book("Effective Java", "Joshua Bloch", "978-0134685991");
        library.addBook(book1);
        library.addBook(book2);

        // Add library members
        LibraryMember member1 = new LibraryMember("John Smith", 101);
        LibraryMember member2 = new LibraryMember("Jane Doe", 102);
        library.addMember(member1);
        library.addMember(member2);

        // Borrow and return books
        library.borrowBook(book1, member1);
        library.borrowBook(book2, member2);
        library.returnBook(book1);

        // Print the status of books
        System.out.println("Books available in the library:");
        for (Book book : library.getBooks()) {
            if (book.isAvailable()) {
                System.out.println(book.getTitle());
            }
        }
    }
}
This is just a basic implementation to give you an idea of how you can structure the Library Management System. In a real-world scenario, you would have more robust implementations and might want to use databases to store book and member information, handle user input more carefully, and add error handling and validation.
